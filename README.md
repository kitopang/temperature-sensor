# temperaturesensor

This program reads the temperature from an DHT22 sensor and displays it through a Python Tkinter GUI running on a RPI. It was used in my 2019 Google Science Fair project to test the viability of storing vaccines through evaporative cooling, a technology which is particularly useful in 3rd-world countries without reliable electricity.
